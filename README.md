A collision editor for Guilty Gear -Strive-, written in Rust. Uses a customized version of https://github.com/super-continent/arcsys for file handling and https://github.com/emilk/egui for GUI.

With this tool, you can add and remove jonbins and boxes, edit boxes, add and remove image names, rename images, and save the file into a format that Strive can read.
