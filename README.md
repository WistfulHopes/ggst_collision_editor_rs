A collision editor for Guilty Gear -Strive-, written in Rust. Uses a customized version of https://github.com/super-continent/arcsys for file handling and https://github.com/emilk/egui for GUI.

Currently, editing is limited to exiting jonbins only. You can add and remove boxes from existing jonbins, but not add new jonbins.
