A collision editor for Guilty Gear -Strive- and other Team Red Arc System Works games, written in Rust. Uses a customized version of https://github.com/super-continent/arcsys for file handling and https://github.com/emilk/egui for GUI.

With this tool, you can add and remove jonbins and boxes, edit boxes, add and remove image names, rename images, clone jonbins into new files, and save the pac into a format that the game can read.

This application is set to automatically work with Xrd, DBFZ, and GGST. To use with GBVS, toggle the Granblue Fantasy Versus checkbox under the Settings button.
